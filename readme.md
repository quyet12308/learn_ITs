# Project to learn knowledge in the IT field and IT Learning Resources Hub

## Introduction

Welcome to the Project to learn knowledge in the IT field and IT Learning Resources Hub repository! This repository is primarily a personal collection of educational materials and code snippets that I have gathered over time. It serves as a centralized location for me to store, manage, and easily access these resources for my own learning and development.

The contents of this repository include a variety of topics and practical examples, collected from different sources. Please note that while I have tried to ensure the usefulness of these materials, I cannot guarantee their absolute accuracy or completeness. They are intended for personal use and self-improvement.

This repository was originally stored on Zalo Cloud, but I have migrated it to GitHub for better organization and easier updates. Feel free to explore the repository, but keep in mind that the materials are primarily curated for my personal learning journey.

If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, your contributions are welcome. Together, we can enhance the quality and usefulness of this collection.
